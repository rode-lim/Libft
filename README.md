# Libft
This is my own library for projects at 42 school

## Getting started...

### Goal:

The goal of the "libft" project is to help students gain a deeper understanding of fundamental C programming concepts and the standard library functions by implementing their own versions of these functions. This project usually involves functions for tasks like string manipulation, memory allocation, and other common operations found in C programming.

### To complete this project you must finish all mandatory functions

By reading my project you will have an idea of the final product.

If you wish for a tutorial you can reach me through email on my main page or personally.


#### Good luck making your functions <3
